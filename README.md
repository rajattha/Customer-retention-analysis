# Customer-retention-analysis
An initiative to reactivate recurring customers after they cancel their ongoing booking. 
‚óè We split the customers in three groups: control group, a group that receives a reactivation email and a group that receives a reactivation call. The customers are assigned randomly to each of these groups.
